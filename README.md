So I over scoped a little bit, but I made the most important parts I think. My original plan was to make a story about this guy that pushes people who he loves away from him,
and they eventually realize that he shouldnt and he has to fight his own inner conflict. I would show this through text that would follow the player as they would look for the next objective and the final enemy would be the angry face
so its like his inner anger that he defeats. But now I have the basic mechanics of searching for the enemy by following the droning and the color of the background. Also the biggest part of the project was the cut scene when you run into the enemy.
It took me way to long to have the freeze frames and the particle systems to look good when you attack the enemy to make it feel REALLY satisfying. I used post-its and paper to make everything. I really leaned into the make it with the
paper aesthetic. I wish I could've added randomly generating background drawings to help populate the world you run around in, and maybe make like post-its for flowers that the player would just break when they ran into it, to give the player
more to do.
